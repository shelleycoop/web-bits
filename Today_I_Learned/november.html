        <h2>19th November</h2>
        <p>Covered a few bits about React Library. It was fun to return to the fundamentals after a long time. I had almost forgotten
            all about it with little practical use all this while. So I went to my Udemy Courses for this but found that Udemy was 
            non-responsive. Again. Is it close to the end? That would be a sad day. I learned a whole lot with this platform. So I went
            to Youtube where John Smilga has made available a major portion of his courses.

            There I explored about 'create element' and 'JSX' among other things.

            Today I also started a major project that could take me few weeks to finish. I was figuring things about ESLint, Primsa
            and Postgres while trying to create the skeleton for it using VS Code as my editor. Neovim days can wait as I have some 
            urgency right now. Neovim I know will take me a bit of time. But once I get up and running with this project will definitely
            pick it up. It's too good to avoid for long. Already I feel like I am late.
