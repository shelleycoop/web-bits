    <p>
        The best way to learn about Neovim isn't necessarily through Tutorials or Documentatrion. Because that can get pretty counter-productive and frustrating pretty 
        fast. Not to say that I have discovered an approach that can help anyone with it. But there is something that I feel is working for me. And I think so honestly. I am
        not saying anything motivated by any hidden opinion.

        So what I have been doing is watching a lot of Podcasts and Personal Comment/Opinion videos about various topics. Of course that would have been pointless
        if I hadn't been introduced to the Neovim. So Tutorials did help me there. I came to know about things that were there to know about Neovim. And perform basic
        tasks so that I am not entirely clueless when I open it.

        But after some time my progress became stagnant. And I also wanted to work on my projects with Neovim but it wasn't possible yet. So there simply google searching my
        problem also helped me. Like one time I searched how to open the list of all the files and folders in my root project directory. And google told me that I should use 
        <:Ex> or <:Explore> to achieve the desired result.
