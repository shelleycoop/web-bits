        So. He seems like a nice guy. Starts by getting to know his audience. And then figures out the traits that distinguish them. If they are programmers or not. Or whether
        they are frontend developers or backend and if they have any experience with Golang as a programming language. All seems okay. I am very interested to watch 
        this video on Day 2 of my 100 Days of Code challenge. This can give me some motivation and push my thoughts in productive directions.

        <h2>Why do we need a server?</h2>
      <p>We need servers because they provide essential services, data, and resources (like websites, apps, files, email) to many users and devices (clients) over a network, 
        enabling centralized storage, sharing, complex processing, and continuous availability that individual computers can't offer, acting as the backbone for the internet 
        and modern business operations. They handle requests, manage security, and allow collaboration, making everything from streaming videos to online banking
        possible by running powerful software and storing large amounts of data reliably.
    </p>
    <h4>Key Functions of Servers:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Hosting & Delivery: Store and deliver website content, apps, and media (images, videos) to your browser or device when requested.</li>
        <li>Data Management: Centralize storage for databases, files, and business records, making them accessible and manageable.</li>
        <li>Complex Processing: Run intensive calculations, manage user authentication, and process transactions that are too demanding for a single client.</li>
        <li>Security & Control: Manage network access, enforce security policies (like CORS), and protect against threats.</li>
        <li>Communication: Power email services, online games, and collaborative platforms like Google Docs.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Why We Can't Do Without Them:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Centralization: Provide a single, reliable source for data and services, rather than scattered files on individual PCs.</li>
        <li>Availability: Designed to run 24/7, ensuring services like websites and email are always online.</li>
        <li>Power: More powerful than standard computers, with greater storage, memory, and processing power to handle high traffic and complex tasks.</li>
        <li>Scalability: Allow services to grow and handle more users by scaling resources up or out as needed.</li>
    </ul>
