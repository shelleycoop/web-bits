        <h2>Reaching to some sort of concrete realisation:</h2>
        <p>This entry is getting added on 26th Feb 2026 which is Day 33 of my challenge. Today has been an interesting day. The 
            wonderful tipping point was a podcast featuring Ryan Fleury where he discussed about a few topics related to memory
            management, C programming, garbage collection and arena. Most of it went over me but I was still able to appreciate 
            the idea that it was some serious programming stuff. And these were the things it was probably okay to be getting 
            excited about. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Next up I watched a video where Nic Barker talked about his experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally I watched my favorite Youtubers Prime and TJ finding their way to making a website using Laravel. I watched the 
            video for about an hour. It was more than eight hours. And when I paused I had come to a point where I felt the need to 
            do something concrete where I can be sure of what I was doing. In short I wanted to know whether I was simply passing time 
            or making some actual progress. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This thought prompted me to think for a while actually. And I realised the same thing that had been on mind for past few 
            weeks actually - that I had develop some sort of expertise with the C language. And so I fell back to the best C resource 
            possible, for me, at Boot.dev which has been instructed by TJ. And there were a few realisations here too. 
        </p>
        <p>
            First of all this was a five hour video, almost. So I had to look for what things I should do here to start. But since I am not a beginner 
            it's not easy for me to sit through the beginning. So I hopped around for things like memory management or something. And for a while 
            I was unable to pick anything. Some things were too easy and some seemed too hard. I decided to continue from  where I had left 
            the last time. But structs were also a topic that were not for the uninitiated. So I figured to start at the beginning. Yeah, that happened.
        </p>
        <p>
            And then I realised that this 5 hour course was supposed to take 5 weeks at least if I had to really make the best use of it. 
            The first section of C basics, which is about 1 hour, should be the thing I should explore first. And this is where I would be 
            spending some time now. Because I don't want to remain a programming noob forever. True that I am now introduced to a lot of fancy 
            things and waiting to explore them is not something that I am too keen to do, but still common sense must prevail.
