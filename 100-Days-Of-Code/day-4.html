            So today was a crazy day. Starting from last evening. It was after I realised that I probably also need to cover some fundamentals before I can deep dive with
            NextJS. So I decided to switch to React. And then I came to the realisation that it is a never ending loop. So better to work on some project. So now I am making
            a mobile app using React Native and this is where most of my time will be spent.
