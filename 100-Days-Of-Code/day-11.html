            Now, some things that are materialising, they are giving me a really good vibe. Finally I am able to spend some time with programming without getting bogged down
            by the difficulty. When something like that happens I take a detour or a break. It's happening very naturally now. I am glad I sticked to programming all these years. 
            Now I no longer feel like a beginner even when I start anything difficult. I am up for it.

            This is very very good and also heartening. For example today I was working with FastAPI. I know it's not recommended to jump on so many technologies all at once
            but I am at a place where I want to have a general feel of the subject. This is not a good habit I know. And I am trying to take measures around this - by giving few hours
            to serious goals on a daily basis and only taking a little time for the exploration.

            But with AI tools in hand the tempation is always there. Because some initial code is readily available. However, that is hardly ever sufficient to create a full-fledged 
            project. So I must simply be consistent.
