        Day 27 - Time to make this site beautiful.

        Day 33 - Now I am grateful. Very much. And all for the realisation about how should I proceed with my programming future in 
        the near future and obviously during this 100 Days of Code phase. I have researched a fair bit about software development - both game
        and web development, and now stand at a point where I can wisely invest into what I should learn and why I should be setting
        some particular goal for me. <br> If you want to know what that exactly is. Read <a href="./finding-my-way.html">this</a>.
