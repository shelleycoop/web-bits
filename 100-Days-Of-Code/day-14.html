            It's sad and tough to see days passing by without some actual progress. I am trying and that's all I can say in my defence. It isn't working as well as it should. But then
            again it's not entirely my fault. Things keep coming up and plans are changing all the time. So much volatility is just leading to chaos and nothing substantial is being
            acheived. But it can't be achieved. At least not in this short span of time. So I just must be regular and stick to my schedule. No matter what.

            Between all this there is some good news though. And that is me getting more and more familiar with how a backend works and moving towards some form of
            expertise in the domain. This is really good for my confidence amidst all that goes on where I wander around in multiple directions incoherently. At least some pattern
            is emerging out of my efforts. And there is at least one consistent theme towards which I can aim at. Frontend is unable to give me that kind of zeal or focus right now.
            I hope that falls into place, too, someday.
