            It's sad and tough to see days passing by without some actual progress. I am trying and that's all I can say in my defence. It isn't working as well as it should. But then
            again it's not entirely my fault. Things keep coming up and plans are changing all the time. So much volatility is just leading to chaos and nothing substantial is being
            acheived. But it can't be achieved. At least not in this short span of time. So I just must be regular and stick to my schedule. No matter what.
