        <p>
            These 3 days made me realize and feel what actual goals should be like. I realised not to run after fancy things and do the hard yards and reach to a place where 
            progress is simply an organic outcome of the efforts put in. A lot of events happened and I can't remember them in order. But they are here in their random order.

                I started working on a learning project. Didn't choose Next.js, only vanilla React for the frontend. Strapi was used as CMS. But the progress was very little. Still working on
                this though. And will continue.
