    <h4>Well, today is the day to plan and think ahead!</h4>
    <p>
        My starting point is going to be the course by Max (Academind) also titled 100 Days of Code. My efforts actually took inspiration from there. I will spend first few 
        days with it. Going back and forth with the topics that can help me better appreciate the art of web development.

        To begin I went straight to the module where he has made a full-fledged project. But there I encountered a little bit of problem. So I realised it would be better
        to go to the previous module and learn about the MVC pattern/architecture. 
    </p>

        This course, however, has limited scope. It doesn't deal much with the frameworks. Only basic intro stuff is there. But there is a lot there still, about fullstack.
        So this 80-hour course will really be something where I should keep my eye on. And I will. Because I still need to unravel backend and databases about which
        there is ample content over here. And the good thing is I will be ablt to learn and understand it from the scratch.
