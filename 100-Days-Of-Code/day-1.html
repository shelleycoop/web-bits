    <h4>Well, today is the day to plan and think ahead!</h4>
    <p>
        My starting point is going to be the course by Max (Academind) also titled 100 Days of Code. My efforts actually took inspiration from there. I will spend first few 
        days with it. Going back and forth with the topics that can help me better appreciate the art of web development. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To begin I went straight to the module where he has made a full-fledged project. But there I encountered a little bit of problem. So I realised it would be better
        to go to the previous module and learn about the MVC pattern/architecture. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This course, however, has limited scope. It doesn't deal much with the frameworks. Only basic intro stuff is there. But there is a lot there still, about fullstack.
        So this 80-hour course will really be something where I should keep my eye on. And I will. Because I still need to unravel backend and databases about which
        there is ample content over here. And the good thing is I will be ablt to learn and understand it from the scratch.

        <h4>Cross-Site Request Forgery</h4>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF or XSRF)</a>is a web security vulnerability that tricks an
            authenticated user into executing unwanted, state-changing actions—such as changing passwords, transferring funds, or updating email addresses—on a trusted
            website without their consent. It exploits the browser's automatic inclusion of credentials (cookies) in requests. 
        </p>
        <h4>Key Aspects of CSRF:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Mechanism:</b>An attacker tricks a victim into visiting a malicious site or clicking a link, which triggers an HTTP request to a vulnerable application where the
                 user is already logged in.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Target:</b> Focuses on state-changing requests (POST, PUT, DELETE) rather than data theft, as the attacker does not receive the response.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Examples: </b>Forcing a user to click a link that transfers money, changes account email, or updates credentials. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Prevention Strategies:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Anti-CSRF Tokens:</b>Implement unique, secret, and unpredictable tokens for each request (or session) that the server validates.</li>
            <li><b>SameSite Cookie Attribute:</b> Configure cookies to SameSite=Strict or SameSite=Lax to prevent browsers from sending them with cross-site requests.</li>
            <li><b>Double Submit Cookies:</b> Send a random value in both a cookie and a request parameter, ensuring they match.</li>
            <li><b>Custom Request Headers:</b> Using AJAX or APIs to require custom headers that cannot be set across origins. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            CSRF differs from Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in that XSS exploits the trust a user has in a site, while CSRF exploits the trust a site has in a user's browser.
