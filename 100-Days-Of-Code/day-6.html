            Today was a different kind of day. But a feel good day. Worked on Python Assignment for a bit where I had to make Trading Bot. Couldn't complete it but it
            made me realise that I should continue with Python and not leave it in between. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This means work will continue on both JavaScript and Python. Of course, there is no TypeScript equivalent to Python. So that makes the journey easier. And 
            Python is anyway easier of these all languages. So makes no sense not touching it at all after giving it this much time. Would also help with ML and Neural Nets.
        </p>

            Also, the most important thing for me to work on is React Native. Using this tool I can make some pet projects. This will give me enormous satisfaction.
            So I must carry the momentum in next days and keep learning React Native. And also React. And understand the core concepts used with both of them.
            Later on I can pick up fancy tchnologies to go with it.
