    <h4>Today is the day to be serious to avoid false steps</h4> 
    <p>
        Last night, just before sleep, I visited the course. There I hopped between multiple sections as per my needs and urge for knowledge. And then I came across the 
        section regarding authentication. It captured my attention. So I start Day 2 with my sights on mastering authentication. Because this is something that isn't really
        my strong suit. In fact I never actually had to implement it for a real project. A shame that is. But moving on.

        So after spending some time on few videos I realised there are some important aspects of this topic. <b>Mainly sessions and cookies.</b>And as a beginner I have to
        understand them. Also, I came across Better Auth and learned that it had gathered quite a good opinion around itself. So it's something to be aware of and 
        possibly explore it if and when I get time. Now I also know there are two things - <b>Authentication and Authorization</b> which play an important role when it comes
        to providing an user access to a software, app or website. And understanding the fine difference between the two terms also allowed me to appreciate them
        in their individual capacities.
