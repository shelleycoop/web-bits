            Time to make good notes and really document the process. Only then I will be able to make sense of all this chaos. Time to be more creative with learning efforts 
            so as not to circle around in a loop. There must be some concrete output everytime. And the progress should be close to linear. Although, that's not always possible.
            But let's set that goal for now.
