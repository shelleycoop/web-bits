        The important thing to understand is how a database stores the user credentials once the user sign ups on the app. As the database is almost always part of the 
        backend and not frontend there is the possibility of some communication happening. How does that happen? This I will be exploring today. Hopefully I will have
        my answers by the end of the day. Also, will look to see if I can create working code for the same.

        Well, as expected I have come to a halt. There is no more progress happening unless I could use some tool where I can see how authentication works. Because it
        won't happen in a vaccum. So I was thinking possibly giving some time to MERN stack or even NextJS for that matter and then get back to authentication.

        Anyway, I will return to it. Hopefully soon.

        But today evening will all be around NextJS.
