    <p>
        The important thing to understand is how a database stores the user credentials once the user sign ups on the app. As the database is almost always part of the 
        backend and not frontend there is the possibility of some communication happening. How does that happen? This I will be exploring today. Hopefully I will have
        my answers by the end of the day. Also, will look to see if I can create working code for the same.
