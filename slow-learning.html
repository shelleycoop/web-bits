    <h1>Slow learning is the best approach.</h1>
    <p>
        Slow learning has been an eye opening approach for me. It has not only helped me grasp things but also has removed turbulence and brought peace and stability
        in my life.  You might ask why? Because this is a pretty weird way to express a thought. But so is the case. And I am not lying. Let me try to explain the whats and hows
        of it all so that you can better appreciate my chain of thought. And see if it works out for you too. That would please me a lot. Certainly.

        Well, people close to me used to make me think that I am pretty smart. Once. But when my life took a bad turn I came to realise I was probably not. At least not as 
        smart as I was thought to be by these people. And in fact I was very much average. So no wonder that programming clicked to me after so many iterations. Also, I was
        initially doing web development and there is not much complexity to it. Only there is so much to learn and understand. There was not very much need for analysis. But here
        I digress.

        So, after starting my journey in the later half of 2021 it was only at the end of 2025 that I began to feel home at programming and things started clicking to me. I still hadn't made much progress 
        but now I realised that that didn't matter. Because there are odds that you will be facing new things and challenges at almost all the times. So you have to tinker
        and develop and prepare your mind for that. Not for something that you are probably to do repeatedly. There muscle memory can also help you sail through. But 
        it is when you face new challenges is that when you are actually tested. And I wanted now to be ready for this.

        Also, I have started working on a personal project that I want to see how far it can go. So with that I am always learning new stuff and this attitude thereby reached to
        me just in time.
